# 🎯 Project: Random Quote Generator

The **Random Quote Generator** is a clean, responsive web application that displays educational and inspiring quotes with the click of a button. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project showcases multiple techniques for handling dynamic content — from basic arrays to object structures and even fetching data from a real-time API.

## 💡 Why I Built This
I created this project to deepen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals like DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with APIs. It also allowed me to experiment with modern UI techniques such as **Glassmorphism** and build a layout that looks great on all screen sizes.

## 🔧 Features
- ✨ Dynamic quote display with each button click  
- 🔁 Implemented in three distinct ways:
  1. Using separate arrays for quotes and authors  
  2. Using an array of objects (quote-author pairs)  
  3. Fetching real-time quotes from an external API (API Ninjas)
- 📱 Fully responsive layout optimized for mobile and desktop  
- 🎨 Modern **glassmorphism** UI for a sleek look and feel

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (with Glassmorphism)
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **Fetch API**
